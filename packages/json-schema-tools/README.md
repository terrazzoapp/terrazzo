# @terrazzo/json-schema-tools

Library for bundling JSON Schema files and parsing [JSON refs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901). Uses [Momoa](https://github.com/humanwhocodes/momoa) to provide support for JSONC and source mapping.

## API

### bundle

Given an array of JSON schema documents, will bundle them in array order, and produces a [Momoa AST](https://github.com/humanwhocodes/momoa) as well as mapping of all `$ref`s resolved.

```ts
import { bundle } from "@terrazzo/json-schema-tools";
import * as momoa from "@humanwhocodes/momoa";

const documents = [
  {
    filename: new URL("file:///foo.json"),
    src: "…", // src may be
  },
];

const { document, refMap } = await bundle(documents);

console.log(document); // Momoa AST
console.log(momoa.evaluate(document)); // produce in-memory JSON object
console.log(momoa.print(document)); // produce JSON string, with original indentation and everything preserved

console.log(refMap); // Key–value mapping of all $refs resolved.
```

#### Options

The `bundle()` method takes an options param as its 2nd argument. These are all the options:

| Name            | Type                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **parse**       | (src: any, filename: URL) => DocumentNode; | Optional wrapper around Momoa’s parser. You may want to do this if you want to transform the sources as they come in, before they are parsed. If providing this function, you must `parse()` using Momoa yourself. |
| **yamlToMomoa** | `yaml-to-momoa`                            | Pass in the module for `yaml-to-momoa` to add support for YAML (`import` it, then pass it as a param).                                                                                                             |

### parseRef

Lower-level function to parse a `$ref` path. Accepts either a string or reference object.

> [!NOTE]
> If pointing to the same file, it will return `.` as the URL.

```ts
import { parseRef } from "@terrazzo/json-schema-tools";

parseRef("tokens.json#/foo/bar"); // { url: 'tokens.json', subpath: ['foo', 'bar'] }
parseRef({ $ref: "#/baz/bat" }); // { url: '.', subpath: ['baz', 'bat'] }
```

### Comparison

| Package                             |      Size | Ops/s | Speed | ESM? |
| :---------------------------------- | --------: | ----: | ----: | :--: |
| @terrazzo/json-schema-tools         |  `0.4 kB` |  9.3M |  100% |  ✅  |
| @apidevtools/json-schema-ref-parser | `82.2 kB` |  2.3M |   25% |      |

_Note: for every package tested, we’re comparing against the lowest-level method that does equivalent work. We’re not comparing apples to oranges and testing extraneous codepaths._

## Additional information

### Why Momoa?

There are 3 main problems with relying on JavaScript’s major parser alone:

1. **It doesn’t preserve original source locations.** For hand-authored JSON, it’s helpful to preserve source maps, and original syntax. That way in case of an error, we can point back to the origin.
2. **It doesn’t support JSONC (JSON with comments) and other quality of life improvements.** Momoa handles JSONC, and when encountering invalid JSON, it can point to the exact file and line of the error, rather than an obscure “somewhere there was a parsing error.”
3. **Transformations are easier.** The native replacer/reviver API isn’t as intuitive as standard AST operations.

Both of these improvements make working with Momoa preferable to raw JSON. And don’t incur a significant performance cost. If you only need the end result, you can simply call `evaluate()` or `print()` from Momoa to flatten it into an object or string respectively. But all the source mapping and AST layers are there if needed.
