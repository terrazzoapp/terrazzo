# About Cobalt

## Project Goals

1. Support the complete and full [W3C Design Tokens CG spec](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format)
2. Support a pluggable and configurable architecture, enabling users and the community to write their own plugins to generate any format
3. Make syncing from Figma easy and automatable ([docs](/docs/integrations/tokens-studio))

## Why the name “Cobalt”?

The name **Cobalt** has three meanings:

1. Cobalt [the element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt) is a nod to design tokens being the “atoms” of your design system<br />
   _Fun fact: the crystalline structure of Cobalt is hexagonal_
2. Cobalt [the pigment](https://artsartistsartwork.com/history-of-the-colour-blue-in-art/) is a nod to blue being the last missing color in art history, just as design tokens are the last missing piece of design systems<br />
   _Fun fact: Van Gogh once said “Cobalt is a divine colour and there is nothing so beautiful for putting atmosphere around things”_
3. Cobalt the color is a nod to [blueprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint)<br />
   _Fun fact: blueprints originally were colored with Prussian Blue (ferrous ferrocyanide), not Cobalt, for cost reasons_
