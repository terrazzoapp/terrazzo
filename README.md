# Cobalt

Design token tooling compatible with the [W3C Design Tokens specification](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/). Cobalt can:

- Parse and validate any valid `tokens.json` file
- Generate Sass, CSS, TypeScript, and more from `tokens.json`
- Keep `tokens.json` in sync from one or multiple Figma files
- Provide a common interface for you to write your own plugins and code generators for your design tokens
