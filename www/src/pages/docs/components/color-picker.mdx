# React Color Picker

Terrazzo’s colorpicker is pretty special: it not only supports all of [CSS Color Module 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/) colorspaces like OKLAB/OKLCH, XYZ, P3, and more (thanks to [Culori](https://culorijs.org/), a fast and accurate color science library). It also renders colors using WebGL for pixel-perfect accuracy in any monitor.

## Demo

<ColorPickerDemo client:load />

## Setup

:::code-group

```sh npm
