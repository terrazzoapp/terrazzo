# About Terrazzo

Terrazzo is a free, MIT-licensed open-source design tool built by <a class="gh-user" href="https://github.com/drwpow"><img class="gh-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1369770?v=4" aria-hidden />@drwpow</a>, <a class="gh-user" href="https://github.com/ntassone"><img class="gh-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1572205?v=4" aria-hidden />@ntassone</a>, and [many other contributors](https://github.com/drwpow/cobalt-ui).

It started out as “Cobalt” in 2021 as tooling for the [W3C Design Token Community Group (DTCG)](https://designtokens.org) format. It was clear early on that a visual token editor was needed, but Drew found the CLI to be as big of a project as he could handle on his own. So along came Nick to design and envision Token Lab in 2024.

The project was renamed to “Terrazzo” to better reflect how lots of colorful little shards of tokens fit together to create a beautiful mosaic when all put together. Also because [lots of things are named “Cobalt”](https://github.com/search?q=cobalt&type=repositories) (or similar-sounding names like “[Cobol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL)”) and it became confusing.
